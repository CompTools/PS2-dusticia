cat /ufrc/zoo6927/share/Class_Files/data/flights.May2017-Apr2018.csv | cut -d "," -f 3 | egrep "\w\w\w" | sort -u | uniq -u

Categorizes airport names by cutting out the 3rd column, searting for three consecutive letters, sorting through lines, and removing repeated lines. The uniq -u function alone does not remove repeated lines that are not adjacent. So, we used sort -u to sort through lines first.
